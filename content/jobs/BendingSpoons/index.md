- In my time at Bending Spoons, I worked to understand the behavior and measure the value of millions of users of our apps.
- Worked with internal support tools teams on App Store Optimisation (ASO). Worked with **Google BigQuery** and **Google Cloud Platform** to prioritise our Apps in locale based search results on the App Store.
- Created a **MongoDB** and **Flask** based RESTful web application to view and edit App metadata to improve results. 
- Handled asynchronous updates using **Celery**, and integrated the tool with Slack using the **Slack API**.

- Worked as a research assistant in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), in the ISTD pillar in Dr Ernest Chong's research group.
- Generalised the Dropout Regularisation method of Deep Neural Networks to a novel two model training approach called "MergeConnect"; enhanced generalisation over unseen data by 2% over dropouts/connect.
- Outperformed dropout on state of art **ResNet32, wide ResNet & ResNeXT** network architectures using benchmarking datasets SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
- Tested method on ResNeXt with skip-connection, data-augmentation & momentum to achieve **96.4% accuracy** on CIFAR-10 dataset, improving error rate over Dropouts by **0.8%**.

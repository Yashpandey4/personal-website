Meet Maeve, an AI bot for [Cannon](https://nestorgames.com/rulebooks/CANNON_EN.pdf) (two-player abstract strategy game). Maeve uses Reinforcement TD Learning \& search to beat (most) humans at the game. Written from scratch in C++, she uses many of the [same strategies](https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/apps/deepBlue.html) that enabled IBM's Deep Blue to beat Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997.

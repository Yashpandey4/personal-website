Pratyush Pandey 🙋‍♂️ is a software developer 🚀 and designer from India 🇮🇳 who occasionally speaks in the third person.

After three years of crafting corners of the Web for others and twelve years after [blogs died](https://www.wired.com/2008/10/st-essay-19/), he knew it was time to build his own.

He’s written more about [himself](#about), but would rather hear from you.

Developed a algorithm visualizer app to demonstrate key insertion and deletion processes in [B Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) and its variants [B+ Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree), [B* Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/b-trees-implementation-in-c/). This data structure is popular in File Storage and DBMS due to faster IO operations.

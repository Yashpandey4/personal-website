A Public Key Infrastructure which uses mixed encryption schemes of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) and [Vignere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) ciphers. Used the GNU Multi-Precision Library [(GMP)](https://gmplib.org/) for strong prime based key pair generation.
